# Train-Titanic-data-using-pipeline-method
This repository provides a comprehensive solution for building, training, and deploying a machine learning pipeline, focusing on the Titanic dataset. The project demonstrates the end-to-end workflow, including data preprocessing, model training, and predictions using a pre-trained pipeline. 
<br>It is an excellent resource for beginners and intermediate machine learning practitioners who want to learn about pipeline creation and practical deployment of machine learning models.

<br>Key Components
<br>Pre-trained Pipeline (pipe.pkl)

<br>This file contains a serialized machine learning pipeline created using Scikit-learn or a similar library.
<br>The pipeline encapsulates data preprocessing steps, feature engineering, and a trained machine learning model, making it easy to reuse for predictions.
<br>Training Data (train.xls)

<br>This dataset serves as the foundational input for training the machine learning model.
<br>Likely related to the Titanic dataset, it contains features such as passenger details, demographics, ticket class, and survival outcomes.
<br>The dataset is clean and well-structured to facilitate seamless preprocessing and training.
<br>Training Notebook (Train_Titanic_Using_Pipeline.ipynb)

<br>A Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to build a machine learning pipeline tailored to the Titanic dataset.
<br>Covers essential steps such as data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and pipeline serialization.
<br>Includes detailed documentation and visualization to make the training process easy to follow.
<br>Prediction Notebook (Predict_Using_Pipeline.ipynb)

<br>A Jupyter Notebook that uses the pre-trained pipeline (pipe.pkl) to make predictions on new data.
<br>Provides insights into how to load and apply a serialized pipeline in real-world scenarios.
<br>Offers a step-by-step guide for making predictions, interpreting results, and refining the pipeline if necessary.
<br>Features and Benefits
<br>Reusable Pipelines: The serialized pipeline in pipe.pkl ensures that all preprocessing steps and model logic are encapsulated, enabling consistent and efficient deployment.
